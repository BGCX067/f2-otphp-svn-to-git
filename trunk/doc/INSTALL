# OTPHP
# An object-oriented one-time password (OTP) authentication library written in PHP
##################################################################################

Installation
============

OTPHP comes with an installation script that will perform an interactive installation of the library and initialization of the server-side database in a directory of your choice.


Configuration Defaults
======================

Install Location - ./OTPHP
OTP Server database password - Generated
OTP Server RSA key bit-length - 4096
OTP password length - 10
Auth fail lockout limit - 5
Number of additional passwords tried for each failure (look-ahead) - 5


Integration
===========

OTPHP at present uses an SQLite database to store client information on both the client and server side, using a different database engine should not present any problems but has not been tested.

When a client is created, all files that must be copied to the client device to allow for integration on the client side are copied into a folder whose name is the new client's ID.
This folder is created inside the client_data folder of the OTPHP installation.

The server-side class accepts authentication requests via the authenticateClient() function.

Authentication requests consist of the client ID and an OTP password, encrypted with the OTP server's public RSA key
	-On the client side, these two variables are accessible via the the OTPClient member variables 's_Password' and 's_ID'

See the AuthServer.php and AuthClient.php classes for a reference implementation of a socket-based network authentication client and server.
